## Unidirectional scattering with spatial homogeneity using photonic time disorder

This repository contains the code and data for preprint [arXiv:2208.11884](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11884), which is to be published in XXX.


### Original Environment
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* AMD Ryzen 3950X 16-core processor with 128 GB RAM 

### Prerequisite
* Python 3.9.6
* Numpy 1.20.3  
* Matplotlib 3.4.2
* Spyder 5.0.5 

---

### Usage
Every .py file for each figure includes:
* definition of time-varying system with the corresponding electromagnetic scattering calculation
* data generation (for ensembles, if needed)
* and plotting figure,
which are separated by a few of cells. Running cells successively will finally result in the output figure in pdf.
